Foremost, I want to express my highest gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Yao Amber LI, for her patient guidance, and continuous support during my study and research. It would be impossible to finish this thesis without her insightful advice along the way. It is my honor to work with such a great advisor for now and future.

My appreciation extends to the rest of my committee members, Professor Jenny XU and Professor David E. COOK for their generous support and solid technique training in macroeconomics, and my advisors at the HKUST Macro Workshop, Professor Marc DORDAL CARRERAS, Professor Byoungchan LEE, and Professor Yang LU for their constructive suggestions at the early stage.

I also appreciate all kinds of help from our fellow students, especially Tengyu ZHAO and Jingbo YAO, and all participants in the HKUST Macro Workshop and HKUST Trade Study Group, who provide much inspiration for my research idea.

Last but not the least, I owe my gratitude to my parents for their long-term nurturing grace, and my girlfriend for her support and encouragement during my hard time.
