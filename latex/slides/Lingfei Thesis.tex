\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Exchange rate shock is a key factor affecting international trade price fluctuations.
		\item Exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) is defined as the elasticity of local price changes to exchange rate fluctuations.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A \textit{complete} ERPT means only the prices in destination currency change with exchange rates; while an \textit{incomplete} ERPT means the prices in producer currency also change.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Exchange rate pass-through measures how exchange rate risk is shared between buyers and sellers of trade.	
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Using detailed Chinese customs transaction records, we separate ERPT into the export and the import side.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The higher the export ERPT, the more volatile the sale price of Chinese exporters in destination market.
			\item The higher the import ERPT, the more unstable the cost of imported material or intermediate goods of Chinese importers.
		\end{itemize}
		\item In this project, we will study China's exchange rate pass-through using import-side micro-level evidence.	
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Questions}
Our questions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item [1] What is the difference between China's import-side exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) and its export-side counterpart?
		\item [2] How do credit constraints of importers affect import ERPT?
		\item [3] What are the channels through which credit constraints affect import ERPT? What factors would enhance or mitigate this effect?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Findings}
We find:	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The average import exchange rate pass-through level in China is significantly less complete than the export one.
		\item Tighter financial constraints will increase both import and export ERPT to be more complete.
		\item Importers with a wider sourcing base (who import a certain product from more sources) have a less complete ERPT and are less affected by credit constraints.
	\end{enumerate}	
\end{frame}

\section{Literature Review}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review: Incomplete Exchange Rate Pass-through}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We first contribute to a wide literature on exchange rate disconnect, particularly on the lack of price sensitivity to exchange rate shocks. \cite{obstfeld2000}, \cite{campa2005}
		\item Two milestone papers link the exchange rate-price elasticity or pass-through to
		disaggregated firm-level characteristics.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \cite{bmm2012} (BMM) provide micro-level evidence of firm heterogeneity in response to real exchange rate shocks.
			\item \cite{aik2014} (AIK) find that
			firms with higher import intensity and larger market share have lower ERPT.
		\end{itemize}
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review: Incomplete Exchange Rate Pass-through}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Three major channels leading to incomplete export exchange rate pass-through in the literature:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Local currency pricing (LCP): short-run nominal price rigidities in the destination currency. \cite{engel2002}, \cite{gopinath2008}
			\item Pricing-to-market (PTM): firms with variable markups optimally set different prices depending on destination market conditions. \cite{atkeson2008}, \cite{bmm2012}, \cite{manova-zhang2012}, \cite{gopinath2010-currency}, \cite{gopinath2010-frequency}
			\item Marginal production cost: home currency appreciation will decrease marginal costs due to cheaper imported inputs, partially offsetting export price changes. \cite{aik2014}, \cite{chatterjee2013}
		\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review: Incomplete Exchange Rate Pass-through}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recent literature reveals more firm-level evidence on heterogeneous pass-through.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \cite{chen2016} find more pricing-to-market and a smaller response of export volumes for higher quality goods.
			\item \cite{lmx2015} (LMX) find that the domestic price response of Chinese exporters to exchange rate changes is very weak.
			\item \cite{garetto2016} and \cite{auer2016}
			argues that firm-level ERPT is a U-shaped function of firm-level productivity and market share; and new entrants under incomplete information, have lower passthrough rates than those under complete information.
			\item \cite{devereux2017} find that ERPT invoicing depend on the market share of both importers (negative) and exporters (U-shaped).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review: Credit Constraints and Trade}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Another important strand of literature discusses the effects of firms’ credit constraints on international trade.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \cite{kroszner2007} first classify firms by industries with different degrees of external financial dependence to study banking crisis.
			\item \cite{manova2013} argues
			that financial market imperfections affect trade because only those firms with sufficient liquidity to finance the additional expenditures can participate in trade.
			\item \cite{chaney2016} defines financially constrained firms as those that lack both sufficient pledgeable assets and sufficient productivity to generate sufficient liquidity on their own.
			\item \cite{feenstra2015}, \cite{manova-wei-zhang2015}, and \cite{fan-lai-li2015} discuss how credit constraints affect Chinese exporters, through incomplete information, multinational links, and quality, respectively.
		\end{itemize}	
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review: Credit Constraints and Trade}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For the relationship between credit constraints and exchange rate pass-through, \cite{strasser2013} shows that financially constrained firms tend to pass more exchange rate shocks to prices.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Borrowing constraints force firms to keep pricing-to-market (PTM) to a
			minimum as they do not have enough margin to adjust markups.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Our project will improve two recent articles discussing credit constraints and ERPT with evidence from China, \cite{dai2021} and \cite{xu-guo2021}, who verify that more financially constrained exporters are more sensitive to exchange rate changes.
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

\section{Data}

\begin{frame}{Data: Customs Transaction Records}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The first dataset is the transaction level records from the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) during 2000-2011.
		\item This dataset provides information on
		all Chinese trade transactions including import and export values, quantities, units, product names and codes, source and destination countries, and type of enterprises.
		\item The categories of products are coded by the Harmonized Coding and Description System (HS) from World Customs Organization (WCO).
		\item We drop unwanted observations referring to \cite{lmx2015}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item products with inconsistent missing information of unit or quantity
			\item special product categories such as arms (HS2=93), antiques (HS2=97), and special categories (HS2=98 and 99)
			\item transactions existing for only one year without any change over time.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data: Firm-level Information}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The second dataset is Chinese Industrial Enterprises (CIE) database from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC).
		\item This dataset covers all state-owned enterprises and above-scale firms
		with annual sales of more than 5 million RMB from 1999 to 2007.
		\item The data provide details about firms’ identification code, ownership, industry
		type, and about 80 other variables in the balance sheet including the number of employees, total wage payments, the value of fixed assets, sales income, total operation inputs, etc.
		\item To merge it with customs records, we match the identification codes based on the contact information of firms as in \cite{fan-li-yeaple2015}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data: Summary Statistics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The summary statistics of the whole customs records, the firm information dataset, and the final matched sample are shown in the panels A, B, and C below, respectively:
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[height=0.65\textheight]{Table3.1.jpg}
		\label{tab3.1}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data: Exchange Rates and Macro Variables}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Nominal exchange rates and price level of household consumption are from Penn World Table (PWT) 10.0 \cite{feenstra2015}.
		\item The bilateral nominal exchange rate is defined as the number of home currency units that can purchase a unit of foreign currency.
		\item The CPI-based real exchange rate ($RER_{ct}$) is defined as:
		$$
		RER_{ct}=NER_{ct} \cdot \frac{CPI_{ct}}{CPI_{CHN,t}}.
		$$
		\item An increase in $RER_{ct}$ means a real depreciation of the Chinese RMB against the
		foreign country’s $c$ currency.
		\item In addition, we use the real GDP of the destination countries from PWT 10.0, computed with national-accounts growth, $RGDP_{ct}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data: Exchange Rates Fluctuations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We saw substantial variations in RMB exchange rate fluctuations against major trading partners of China during 1999-2011.
		\begin{columns}
			\column{0.5\columnwidth}
			\begin{figure}[htbp]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=1.1\columnwidth]{Figure3.1.jpg}
				\label{fig3.1}
			\end{figure}
			\column{0.5\columnwidth}
			\begin{figure}[htbp]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=1.1\columnwidth]{Figure3.2.jpg}
				\label{fig3.2}
			\end{figure}
		\end{columns}
		\item The real exchange rate against the US dollar did not change a lot in 2000-2004 due to the nominal pegging scheme. In 2005, the peg was lifted to appreciation due to the evolution of exchange policy.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Empirical Framework}

\begin{frame}{Baseline Estimation Equation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The first step goal is to estimate exchange rate pass-through as the elasticity of unit values changes to exchange rate changes.
		\begin{equation}
			\Delta \ln P^{D}_{i j c t}=\alpha+\beta^D \Delta \ln R E R_{c t}+\gamma \Delta \ln R G D P_{c t}+\xi_{i j c}+\tau_{t}+\varepsilon_{i j c t}
			\label{eq4.1}
		\end{equation}
		{\footnotesize where $P_{ijct}$ is the price of the product $i$ bought (sold) by firm $j$ from country $c$ in year $t$.  $D \in$ \{Import, Export\} denotes the trade direction. $\xi_{ijc}$ denotes the firm-product-country level fixed effects. $\tau_t$, the year dummies, control for common macro-shocks across firms.}
		\item To deal with possible non-stationarity, we use the first difference of the logarithms for prices $\Delta \ln P^{D}_{i j c t}$, real exchange rates $\Delta \ln R E R_{c t}$ and real GDP $\Delta \ln R G D P_{c t}$ to represent their annual rates of change.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unit Value as Price}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The customs records contain trade values (by US dollars) and quantities for each HS6 product $i$, each firm $j$, from (or to) each country $c$, in each year $t$, $V_{ijct}$, and $Q_{ijct}$.
		\item The real prices for export and import $P^{Import}_{i j c t}$ and $P^{Export}_{i j c t}$ are computed as unit values, both denominated by the Chinese RMB:
		$$
		P^{D}_{ijct}=\frac{V^{D}_{ijct}\cdot NER_{US,t}}{Q^{D}_{ijct}}
		$$
		\item Because product categories are highly subdivided, we believe that the unit value is an ideal proxy for the transaction price.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Baseline Estimation Coefficients}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The coefficient $\beta^{D=Import}$ measures the completeness of import exchange rate pass-through, i.e. a higher $\beta$ means Chinese importers face more volatile import RMB prices during exchange rate shocks.
		\item However,  $\beta^{D=Export}$ means the "incompleteness" of the export pass-through because a higher $\beta$ means Chinese exporters pass less exchange rate change to the destination market while having more volatile domestic currency prices.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Estimations with Credit Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We study the credit constraint effects on exchange rate pass-through by including an interaction term of sectors’ financial vulnerability:
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				\Delta \ln P^{D}_{ijct}=&\alpha+\beta^D_{1} \Delta \ln RER_{ct}+\beta^D_{2} \Delta \ln RER_{ct} \cdot FV_{j} \\ &+\gamma \Delta \ln RGDP_{ct}+\xi_{ijc}+\tau_{t} +\varepsilon_{ijct}
			\end{aligned}
			\label{eq4.2}
		\end{equation}
		{\footnotesize where $FV_{j}$ is the financial vulnerability of the sector to which the firm $j$ belongs.}
		\item The interaction coefficient $\beta_2$ represents the effect of industry-level credit constraints on exchange rate pass-through.
		\item The overall import ERPT for firm $j$ is given by $\beta^D_{1} +\beta^{Import}_{2} FV_j$ and the overall export ERPT is $\beta^D_{1} +\beta^{Export}_{2} FV_j$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Measures of Credit Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Following \cite{manova-wei-zhang2015} and \cite{fan-lai-li2015}, we use sector-level financial vulnerability measures to proxy for credit needs (demand for outside capital) and the ability to resist financial risks.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{External Finance Dependence ($ExtFin_j$)}: the share of capital expenditures not financed by operational cash flows.
			\item \textbf{Asset Tangibility ($Tang_j$)}: the share of the net value of tangible assets that firms can pledge as collateral to raise external finance, in its total book value.
			\item \textbf{Inventory-to-sales Ratio ($Invent_j$)}: measure of the production cycle duration and the necessary working capital to maintain inventories and meet demand. 
		\end{enumerate}
		\item We also construct the \textbf{first principal component} $FPC_j$ of external finance dependence and asset tangibility as an aggregate measure.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Measures of Credit Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Alternatively, we also compute measures of credit needs based on Chinese firm-level information, with an additional of R\&D intensity.
		\item Below are the summary statistics of US and Chinese measures of credit constraints.
		\begin{figure}[htbp]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Table4.1.jpg}
			\label{tab4.1}
		\end{figure}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Additional Firm-level Factors}
	To answer the third question, we introduce a vector $\mathbb{Z}_{jt}$ (or its lagged form $\mathbb{Z}_{jt-1}$) to include additional factors which may affect ERPT.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Sourcing Diversity}: defined as the number of source countries from which an importer $j$ imports a certain HS6 product type $i$. 
		\item \textbf{Markup}: estimated by the GMM method following \cite{dlw2012} and \cite{bkl2021}.
		\item \textbf{Market Share}: defined as a firm’s value share in the import market, within a given HS6 product category.
		$$
		S^{D}_{ijct} \equiv \frac{v^{D}_{ijct}}{\sum_{j^{\prime} \in J_{ict}} v^{D}_{ij^{\prime}ct}}
		$$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Estimations with Additional Factors}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Estimation equations with additional factors $\mathbb{Z}_{jt-1}$:
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				\Delta \ln P^{D}_{ijct} =&\alpha+[\beta^D_{1}+ \beta^D_{2} \cdot FV_{j}+\beta^D_{3} \cdot {\mathbb{Z}^{D}_{jt-1}}'] \Delta \ln RER_{ct} \\
				&+\gamma \Delta \ln RGDP_{ct}+ {\mathbb{Z}^{D}_{jt}}' \eta+\xi_{ijc}+\tau_{t} +\varepsilon_{ijct}.
				\label{eq4.3}
			\end{aligned}	
		\end{equation}
		
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				\Delta \ln P^{D}_{ijct}=&\alpha+[\beta^D_{1}+ \beta^D_{2} \cdot FV_{j}+\beta^D_{3} \cdot {\mathbb{Z}^{D}_{jt-1}}'+\beta^D_{4} \cdot FV_{j} \cdot {\mathbb{Z}^{D}_{jt-1}}'] \Delta \ln RER_{ct} \\ 
				&+\gamma \Delta \ln RGDP_{ct}+ {\mathbb{Z}^{D}_{jt}}' \eta+\xi_{ijc}+\tau_{t} +\varepsilon_{ijct}.
			\end{aligned}	
			\label{eq4.4}
		\end{equation}
		\item When using market share and its square term as additional factors:
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{aligned}
				\Delta \ln P^{D}_{ijct}=&\alpha+[\beta^D_{1}+ \beta^D_{2} \cdot FV_{j}+\beta^D_{3} \cdot S^{D}_{ijct}+\beta^D_4 \cdot {S^{D}_{ijct}}^2] \Delta \ln RER_{ct} \\
				&+\gamma \Delta \ln RGDP_{ct}+ \eta S^{D}_{ijct}+\xi_{ijc}+\tau_{t} +\varepsilon_{ijct}.
			\end{aligned}
			\label{eq4.5}
		\end{equation}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Empirical Results}

\begin{frame}{Results: Import Pass-through vs Export Pass-through}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The results for import exchange rate pass-through versus export exchange rate pass-through are shown below using different samples.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{Table5.1.jpg}
		\label{tab5.1}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results: Import Pass-through vs Export Pass-through}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white, colframe=blue!75!black,title=Key Finding 1]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The average import exchange rate pass-through level in China is significantly less complete than the export one.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{tcolorbox}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For Chinese firms, when RMB depreciates against the currencies of major trading partners, export prices denominated in RMB will not rise significantly, but their import costs will rise sharply; 
		\item On the contrary, when the real exchange rate of RMB appreciates, export prices in RMB will decrease only to a limited extent, and their import costs will increase dramatically drop.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results: Effects of Credit Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Panel A presents differences in import exchange rate pass-through caused by industry-level credit demand heterogeneity as equation \ref{eq4.2}.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Table5.2A.jpg}
		\label{tab5.2A}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results: Effects of Credit Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Panel B presents comparable results for effects of credit constraints on export exchange rate pass-through.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Table5.2B.jpg}
		\label{tab5.2B}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results: Effects of Credit Constraints}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white, colframe=blue!75!black,title=Key Finding 2]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Tighter financial constraints will increase both import and export ERPT to be more complete.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{tcolorbox}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Credit constraints expose Chinese manufacturing firms to greater exchange rate risk in international trade.}
		\item Exporters with more vulnerable credit sharply lower destination prices when RMB depreciates, while RMB revenue remained stable, and restricted importers' costs rose more significantly; 
		\item In contrast, when RMB appreciates, restricted exporters will increase destination prices more, even if it means losing their competitive advantages, and restricted importers' costs will be reduced.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results: Sourcing Diversity and Credit Constraints}
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{Table5.3.jpg}
		\label{tab5.3}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results: Sourcing Diversity and Credit Constraints}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white, colframe=blue!75!black,title=Key Finding 3]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Importers with a wider sourcing base (who import a certain product from more sources) have a less complete ERPT and are less affected by credit constraints.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{tcolorbox}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If a firm can import the same product from more sources, it has more flexibility to escape the unfavorable exchange rate risk.
		\item A more diverse importer can either switch from one source to another to reduce costs (trade diversion effect), or make a more credible threat to negotiate a more stable price.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{More Discussions}

\begin{frame}{Discussion on Firm Heterogeneity in Markup}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \cite{bmm2012} and \cite{lmx2015} suggest that different markup levels lead to
		heterogeneous responses to exchange rate shocks. We verify this by including markup in equation \ref{eq4.3} and \ref{eq4.4}.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{TableA2.jpg}
		\label{tabA2}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Discussion on Firm Heterogeneity in Markup}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Does this logic also work for import exchange rate pass-through?
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{Table6.1.jpg}
		\label{tab6.1}
	\end{figure}
		\item Importers with higher markup also have less complete ERPT!
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Discussion on Firm Heterogeneity in Market Share}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We provide the regression results of equation \ref{eq4.5} with the market share and its square term as additional factors.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Table6.2.jpg}
		\label{tab6.2}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Discussion on Firm Heterogeneity in Market Share}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To test whether there is U-shape relationship between markup and ERPT, we perform group regressions by market share quartile.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Table6.3.jpg}
		\label{tab6.3}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Discussion on Future Research}
How can we further decipher the mechanisms that affect exchange rate pass-through?
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Import-export Linkage
		\begin{itemize}
			\item "Pressure-reducing
			valve": when a firm has the ability to pass more exchange rate fluctuations to destination prices, it has more room to absorb price fluctuations of imported inputs.
			\item Advantages in some firm characteristics may bring
			greater bargaining power on both the import the export side and thus cause lower export and import price pass-through as in \cite{aik2014}.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Time Trend of China’s Exchange Rate Pass-through
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How do the (import and export) exchange rate pass-through levels of China evolve over time?
			\item Is this trend of exchange rate pass-through affected by loosening credit constraints and/or industry switching?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In this paper, we provide evidence at a disaggregated level for the incomplete import exchange rate pass-through in China and reveal how importers’ financial constraints affect the pass-through.
		\item We find that:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item the average import exchange rate pass-through in China is around 35-40\%, far below the 95\% level for export pass-through;
			\item both import and export exchange rate pass-through are more complete for firms in industries with tighter credit constraints;
			\item import source diversity can effectively reduce import price pass-through and offset the effects of credit constraints
		\end{enumerate}
		\item In the future, we need to explore the underlying mechanism by which credit constraints affect exchange rate pass-through and the implications on the evolving trend of exchange rate pass-through.
